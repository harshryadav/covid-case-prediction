## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into 7 main sections:

### 1. Introduction and Setup (Cells 1-2)

**What it does**: Sets the stage and imports all necessary tools

**Key points**:
- Explains the real-world problem we're solving
- Lists data sources (JHU COVID-19, Google Mobility)
- Imports our custom utilities and GluonTS models
- Sets up nice plotting defaults

**What you'll learn**:
- How to structure a complete forecasting application
- What tools and data sources you need

---

### 2. Data Loading and Exploration (Cells 3-5)

**What it does**: Loads real COVID-19 data and helps you understand it

**Key features**:
- Uses our convenient `load_covid_data_for_gluonts()` function
- Shows data statistics and date ranges
- Visualizes time series patterns (cases, deaths, mobility)
- Identifies key patterns (waves, seasonality, behavioral changes)

**What you'll learn**:
- How to load and prepare COVID-19 data
- What patterns exist in the data
- Why visualization matters before modeling

**Tip**: The three time series plots show you:
1. **Cases**: Multiple distinct waves over time
2. **Deaths**: Lagged correlation with cases
3. **Mobility**: Behavioral responses to the pandemic

---

### 3. Feature Engineering (Cells 6-7)

**What it does**: Explains and visualizes the engineered features

**Features created**:
- `Daily_Cases_MA7`: Smoothed case counts (removes weekly noise)
- `Daily_Deaths_MA7`: Smoothed death counts
- `CFR`: Case Fatality Ratio (deaths/cases)
- 6 mobility metrics (retail, workplace, transit, etc.)

**Why these matter**:
- **Deaths**: Strong predictor of case severity
- **CFR**: Captures how deadly the virus is at different times
- **Mobility**: Shows behavioral changes (lockdowns work!)
- **Moving averages**: Remove reporting artifacts (weekend dips)

**What you'll learn**:
- How to engineer meaningful features for forecasting
- How to analyze feature correlations
- Which features are most predictive

**Tip**: The correlation plot shows which features move together with cases. Positive correlation = feature increases with cases. Negative = feature decreases when cases rise.

---

### 4. Model Training (Cells 8-13)

**What it does**: Trains all three models with detailed output

**Models trained**:

#### 4.1 DeepAR (Most Sophisticated)
- **What**: Autoregressive RNN with external features
- **Strengths**: Captures complex temporal patterns, uses all features
- **Training time**: ~3-4 minutes
- **Best for**: When you have rich feature data and need high accuracy

#### 4.2 SimpleFeedForward (Baseline)
- **What**: Simple neural network baseline
- **Strengths**: Very fast training, easy to understand
- **Training time**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Best for**: Quick experiments, benchmarking, stable trends

---

### 5. Model Comparison (Cells 14-16)

**What it does**: Compares all models systematically

**Metrics used**:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Average prediction error
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors more
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Error as a percentage
- **Training Time**: How fast each model trains

**Visualizations**:
- Side-by-side forecast plots for all three models
- Confidence intervals showing uncertainty
- Comparison against actual values

**What you'll learn**:
- How to evaluate forecasting models properly

## Key Concepts Explained

### Probabilistic Forecasting

Unlike simple point predictions, our models provide **probabilistic forecasts**:

```python
# Not just: "We predict 50,000 cases"
# But: "We predict 50,000 cases, with 80% confidence it will be between 40,000-60,000"
```

**Why this matters**:
- **Risk assessment**: Wide intervals = high uncertainty = higher risk
- **Resource planning**: Plan for the range, not just the average
- **Decision-making**: Know when predictions are reliable vs. uncertain

**In the notebook**: Look for the shaded regions around forecasts - these show confidence intervals!

---

### External Features (Covariates)

Most forecasting models only use historical values. Our advanced models (DeepAR, DeepNPTS) also use **external features**:

- **Deaths data**: Leading indicator of severity
- **Mobility patterns**: Behavioral changes affect transmission
- **CFR**: Captures how deadly the virus is

**Why this matters**:
- More information = better predictions
- Can capture causality (lockdowns → reduced mobility → fewer cases)
- Enables scenario analysis (change mobility, predict case impact)

**In the notebook**: Compare DeepAR (uses features) vs. SimpleFeedForward (doesn't) to see the impact!

---

### Model Comparison

We train three different models because:

1. **No single model is always best**: Different models excel in different situations
2. **Robustness**: If all models agree, you can be more confident
3. **Learning**: Understanding tradeoffs helps you pick the right tool

**How to choose**:
- **Need accuracy?** Test all models, pick the best performer
- **Need speed?** SimpleFeedForward trains in seconds
- **Regime changes?** DeepNPTS handles distribution shifts well
- **Rich features?** DeepAR leverages external data best

---

### Scenario Analysis

The most powerful application of forecasting is asking **"what if?"**

Example questions you can answer:
- "What if we implement a lockdown?"
- "What if vaccination rates increase?"
- "What if a new variant emerges?"

**How it works**:
1. Train model on historical data
2. Create scenarios with different future conditions
3. Generate forecasts for each scenario
4. Compare outcomes to guide decisions

**In the notebook**: We simulate a strong intervention and quantify its impact. In a real application, you'd create multiple scenarios with different intervention strengths!

## Customization Guide

### Using Your Own Data

Replace COVID-19 data with your own time series:

1. **Prepare your data**:
   ```python
   # Your time series (target variable)
   df = pd.DataFrame({
       'Date': [...],
       'target_value': [...]
   })
   
   # Optional: external features
   features_df = pd.DataFrame({
       'Date': [...],
       'feature1': [...],
       'feature2': [...]
   })
   ```

2. **Merge and format**:
   ```python
   from GluonTS_utils_gluonts import create_gluonts_dataset
   
   train_ds, test_ds = create_gluonts_dataset(
       df, 
       target_col='target_value',
       feature_cols=['feature1', 'feature2'],
       ...
   )
   ```

3. **Train models**: Use the same training code!

---

### Adjusting Forecast Horizon

Change from 14-day to different horizons:

```python
# 7-day forecast
prediction_length = 7
context_length = 28  # Usually 2-4x prediction length

# 30-day forecast  
prediction_length = 30
context_length = 90
```

**Tradeoff**: Longer horizons are harder to predict accurately but more useful for long-term planning.

---

### Tuning Model Parameters

Experiment with these key parameters:

**DeepAR**:
```python
epochs = 20          # More = better fit (but slower)
hidden_size = 60     # Bigger = more capacity
num_layers = 3       # Deeper = more complex patterns
dropout = 0.2        # Higher = more regularization
```

**SimpleFeedForward**:
```python
epochs = 30          # It's fast, so you can train longer!
hidden_dimensions = [60, 60, 30]  # Can add more layers
```

**DeepNPTS**:
```python
epochs = 20
num_hidden_nodes = [60]  # Can add more nodes
dropout_rate = 0.15
```

---

### Adding More Scenarios

Create additional "what if" scenarios:

```python
scenarios = {
    'Baseline': {
        'mobility_change': 0.0,
        'expected_reduction': 0.0
    },
    'Mild Intervention': {
        'mobility_change': -0.15,  # 15% reduction
        'expected_reduction': 0.08  # 8% case reduction
    },
    'Strong Intervention': {
        'mobility_change': -0.30,  # 30% reduction
        'expected_reduction': 0.15  # 15% case reduction
    },
    'Full Lockdown': {
        'mobility_change': -0.60,  # 60% reduction
        'expected_reduction': 0.35  # 35% case reduction
    }
}
```

Then visualize all scenarios side-by-side!

## Common Questions

### "Which model should I use?"

**Answer**: It depends on your priorities!

| Priority | Best Model | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Highest accuracy | Test all, pick best | Performance varies by dataset |
| Fast training | SimpleFeedForward | Trains in <1 minute |
| Rich features | DeepAR | Best at using external data |
| Regime changes | DeepNPTS | Handles distribution shifts |

**Pro tip**: In production, many teams use **ensembles** - combine multiple models for better robustness!

---

### "How accurate are these forecasts?"

**Answer**: It varies!

- **Short-term** (1-7 days): Usually quite accurate (MAPE < 10%)
- **Medium-term** (7-14 days): Good for planning (MAPE 10-20%)
- **Long-term** (>14 days): Higher uncertainty (MAPE > 20%)

**Factors affecting accuracy**:
- **Data quality**: More frequent data = better predictions
- **Pattern stability**: Stable trends are easier to predict
- **External shocks**: New variants, policy changes create uncertainty

**Key insight**: Always look at confidence intervals, not just point predictions!

---

### "Can I use this for other diseases?"

**Absolutely!** The approach generalizes:

- **Flu forecasting**: Replace COVID data with flu data
- **Hospital admissions**: Use admission counts instead of cases
- **Disease outbreaks**: Apply to any infectious disease

**What to change**:
1. Load your disease data instead of COVID
2. Engineer relevant features (may differ by disease)
3. Adjust forecast horizons based on disease dynamics
4. Same models, same evaluation approach!

---

### "How often should I retrain models?"

**Answer**: It depends on your application!

**For COVID-19**:
- **Daily**: During active outbreaks (patterns change fast)
- **Weekly**: During stable periods (less critical)
- **After shocks**: Always retrain after major events (new variants, policy changes)

**General rule**: Retrain when:
- New data substantially changes patterns
- Forecast accuracy degrades
- External conditions shift dramatically

**In production**: Set up automated retraining (daily/weekly schedule) and monitor forecast quality metrics!

---

### "What if my forecasts are way off?"

**Debugging checklist**:

1. **Check data quality**:
   - Missing values?
   - Outliers or data errors?
   - Sufficient history (at least 2x forecast horizon)?

2. **Verify features**:
   - Are features available for forecast period?
   - Features properly aligned with target?
   - Correct number of features specified?

3. **Tune models**:
   - Try more training epochs
   - Adjust network size (hidden_size, hidden_dimensions)
   - Change context length

4. **Evaluate uncertainty**:
   - Wide confidence intervals = model knows it's uncertain!
   - This is actually a feature, not a bug

**Pro tip**: Sometimes poor forecasts reveal real changes in the underlying process (new variant, behavioral shift). Investigate why, don't just tune blindly!
